    <br><br><br>About Me:<br>
    I currently reside in the Central Valley, which is a perfect match for my main<br> 
    hobbies of hiking and fishing. As the name implies, I am central most to activities <br>
    and places in California. There are beautiful hiking and fishing spots
    all within <br>2-3 hours of where I live. If I want to travel in-state, Los Angeles is only 3-4 hours <br>away. San
    Francisco, 1-2 hours. Yosemite, 2-3 hours. These are things residents of Central <br>Valley tell themselves to justify
    their existence and when they want to sell their house <br>to the next victim.
    My only future goal is to basically travel the world. It might seem a bit <br>dramatic but every step and breath I take,
    must get me closer to realizing that dream. <br>Why? So, about a month before the pandemic, I got the opportunity to
    travel around Europe for <br>about 3 weeks. I basically picked a spot on the map and headed off. My single rule was to
    only <br>plan one new destination at a time. I started off in Lisbon, Portugal. After a couple days, <br>I headed off to
    Valencia, Spain. I then hopped on a train to Barcelona, Spain. All together, <br>I also visited Maranello (Forza
    Scuderia Ferrari!) and Rome, Italy; Paris, France; London, UK. <br>I could write a whole book about my experience
    backpacking in Europe, but better writers have already <br>done that. The main takeaway for me was, even though all
    those places had their unique traits, customs, <br>culture, etc.. I still felt a certain level of similarity,
    familiarity, and wholenessirity (not a word yet) <br>of the human experience. I fell in love with that experience and
    now my life mission is to relive those <br>moments everyday for the rest of my life.
